[LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) have become extremely useful as a programming aid.

They can:

- explain code,
- explain programming concepts,
- write well-documented code.

Let's have a first try at it: we will use an LLM to download a text from the internet and do some basic text analyses.

You can find the material [here](https://mint.westdri.ca/python/top_llm).
