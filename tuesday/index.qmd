## Using AI to write Python code

:::{.topdef}

**Time:** \
1pm–4pm

**Instructor:** \
Marie-Hélène Burle (Simon Fraser University)

**Live notes:** \

**Material:** \
[Website](https://mint.westdri.ca/python/top_llm)

**Topic:** \
[LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) have become extremely useful as a programming aid.

They can:

- auto-complete code,
- explain programming concepts,
- explain code,
- write code,
- debug code,
- write software tests,
- write entire programs, websites, and applications ([vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding)).

Let's have a first try at it: we will use an LLM to download a text from the internet and do some basic text analyses. In the process, we will learn new Python concepts.
