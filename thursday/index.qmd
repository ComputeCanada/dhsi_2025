**Topic:** \
Today, you will be working in teams on a project of your own. Your goal is to extract useful data from a website, either via API querying (if the option is available) or via web scraping (if your site has no API).

It would be fantastic if you could chose a website that contains data useful for your research or that is of interest to you. If you don't have any idea however, we will provide a list of site suggestions.

Try to pair up with one or more people having a similar interest.

Of course, we will be with you all day to help!
