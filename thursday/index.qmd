**Topic:** \
Today, you will be working in teams on a project of your own. Your goal is to extract useful data from a website, either via API querying (if the option is available) or via web scraping (if your site has no API).

Try to pair up with one or more people having a similar interest.

Of course, we will be with you all day to help!

It would be fantastic if you could chose a website that contains data useful for your research or that is of interest to you. If you don't have any idea however, here is a list of sites that have well-built APIs:

- [Hathi Trust Hathifiles](https://www.hathitrust.org/member-libraries/resources-for-librarians/data-resources/hathifiles/)
- [Hathi Trust bibliographic API](https://www.hathitrust.org/member-libraries/resources-for-librarians/data-resources/bibliographic-api/)
- [New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis)
- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/developers/index-apis.html)
- [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)
- [Getty Museum](https://data.getty.edu/)
- [Library of Congress](https://guides.loc.gov/digital-scholarship/accessing-digital-materials#s-lib-ctab-26648178-2)
- [World Bank](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/topics/125589-developer-information)
- [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/)
