Python is a powerful\n> tool in data science as it can automate tasks and facilitate data\n> analysis. One of the main reasons Python is a popular programming\n> language is its extensive external libraries and packages which can\n> introduce new functionalities, tailored to different applications, to\n> the base version of Python. Installing all the external packages\n> individually can be time-consuming and as such, we recommend Anaconda,\n> an all-in-one installer which comes with the most popular external\n> packages for Python. Regardless of how you choose to install Python\n> (via Anaconda or not), please make sure you install Python version 3.x\n> (3.6 or higher is recommended).\n>\n> We will mainly teach Python using the JupyterLab, a programming\n> environment that runs in a web browser (JupyterLab will be installed\n> by Anaconda automatically). For this to work you will need a\n> reasonably up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome,\n> Safari and Firefox browsers are all supported. We will also discuss\n> PyCharm and Spyder as an alternative environment for code in Python\n> (Spyder will also be installed automatically via Anaconda).\n\n# Instructions for Windows users {#instructions-for-windows-users .unnumbered}\n\n# Open the following link with your web browser:\n\n[[https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section]{.underline}](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section)\n\n1.  Click on the \"Download\" button which will then download the Anaconda\n    for Windows installer with Python 3 (see the screenshot below).\n\n> If you are not sure which version to choose, you probably want the\n> 64-bit Graphical Installer Anaconda3-\\...-Windows-x86_64.exe\n>\n> ![](media/image9.png){width=\"6.323375984251968in\"\n> height=\"4.039652230971129in\"}\n>\n> 3\\.

Click on the \"Download\" button and download the Anaconda Installer\n    with Python 3 for Linux. (The installation requires using the shell.\n    If you aren\\'t comfortable doing the installation yourself stop here\n    and request help at the workshop.)\n\n2.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the\n    executable is downloaded (e.g., \\`cd \\~/Downloads\\`).\n\n3.  Type:\n\n> bash Anaconda3-\n>\n> and then press Tab to autocomplete the full file name. The name of the\n> file you just downloaded should appear.\n\n4.  Press Enter (or Return depending on your keyboard). You will follow\n    the text-only prompts. To move through the text, press Spacebar.\n    Type yes and press enter to approve the license. Press Enter (or\n    Return) to approve the default location for the files. Type yes and\n    press Enter (or Return) to prepend Anaconda to your PATH (this makes\n    the Anaconda distribution the default Python).\n\n5.  Close the terminal window.\n\n# Make sure you can open JupyterLab on your browser: {#make-sure-you-can-open-jupyterlab-on-your-browser .unnumbered}\n\n> After finishing the setup process above, you can navigate to your\n> terminal (Anaconda prompt in windows).
