    "text": "In today’s digital world, being able to access and work with online data is a valuable skill, even in the Humanities and Social Sciences. This session is all about getting comfortable with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and understanding why they’re useful for research. You’ll learn how APIs compare to other ways of getting data, like text mining and web scraping, and how to tell if a website has an API you can use. We’ll walk through how to make a request to an API, use parameters to get the exact data you want, and understand the responses you get back (usually in JSON format). By the end, you’ll have hands-on experience using APIs to gather and explore data for your own projects.\nLet’s get started by importing the libraries that we will be using:\n#Your code goes here\nLet’s explore the requests and json libraries using the Help function:\n#Your code goes here\n#Your code goes here\nLet’s get started with some hands-on API querying!\nFor our first example, we’ll use an easy-to-understand API from catfact.ninja, a site that serves up random cat facts, perfect for learning the basics in a fun way.\n1. Create a variable for base URL\nLet’s do a simple request and see what we get:\n#Your code goes here\n2. Create a variable for the cat facts response\n#Your code goes here\nLet’s explore the ‘responses’ library:\n#Your code goes here\n#Your code goes here\n#Your code goes here\nThe output for the .text function is actually JSON (Javascript object notation). If we apply a JSON method we can export this as a dictionary, which will be much easier for us to work with:\n#Your code goes here\n3. Querying parameters\n#Your code goes here\nLet’s create a variable to save this parameter:\n#Your code goes here"

If you refer to the JSON data, you’ll see that it’s actually a list of keys and their corresponding values. For example, there’s a “birth_year” key whose value is “19BBY” as well as an “eye_color” key whose value is “blue.”\nWe can refer to the JSON data by its key:\n\n#Your code goes here\n\nIn the statement above, we are setting a new variable called hair. The variable is composed of the value of the hair_color key, as specified in the data you see in the previous cell.\nWe also set a variable called name, which is composed of the value of the name key.

    "text": "Before we jump into analyzing data, let’s talk about one of the most powerful tools in programming: variables. Think of a variable like a storage box where you can put information that you might want to use later. This is how we make computers remember things for us!\nLet’s start with something simple. Imagine using Python like a calculator. You can do quick math, like this:\n\n2 + 5 * 8\n\n42\n\n\nThis is very handy, but let’s be honest, it’s not very exciting. What makes programming powerful is the ability to store this result or any other data, and use it again whenever we need it. That’s where variables come in.\n\n\nA variable is a name that refers to a value. In the previous example, we saw that we can use Python as an advanced calculator. However, the results of these computations are lost after we perform our operations. If we want to save and reuse any value in a code, we need to save these computations in a place in computer memory to be able to access it in the future.\nVariables are names that we associate with a memory location in computers. As such variables are not values themselves but they point to a memory location where the actual values are stored.\n\nweight_kg = 60\nweight_kg\n\n60\n\n\nNow, Python will remember that weight_kg equals 60. Instead of doing the math all over again or writing the number repeatedly, we just use weight_kg whenever we need it.\nA Few Rules for Naming Variables: - You can use letters, digits, and **underscores (_), but the name can’t** start with a digit. - Variable names are case-sensitive, so weight and Weight are two different things.\nFor example: - weight0 is valid, but 0weight isn’t. - weight_kg is different from Weight_kg.\n\n\n\nPython can work with different types of data. Three of the most common types are:\n\nIntegers (whole numbers like 1, 2, 100)\nFloating point numbers (numbers with decimals like 2.5, 60.3)\nStrings (text like “Hello”, “001”)\nBooleans (True or False)\n\nFor example, let’s say we want to store a patient’s weight. If the weight is exactly 60 kilograms, we can use an integer:\n\nweight_kg = 75\n\nBut if we want to be more precise, like 60.3 kilograms, we can use a floating point number:\n\nweight_kg = 75.3\n\nHere, weight_kg is a variable that stores a decimal number, or a float. It could represent any weight in kg measurement, which we might later use for calculations or comparisons.\nWe can also store text:\n\nname = \"John Doe\"\n\nStrings can store text data, which can be useful for labeling or adding metadata.\nAnd lastly, we have booleans, which are used to represent true or false values. They are helpful in logical operations or conditions:\n\nheight_cm = 165\n\nis_tall= height_cm &gt; 180 \n\nis_tall\n\nFalse\n\n\nWith this variable, we could decide whether to apply certain calculations or adjustments based on the height. It can help us write cleaner, more conditional code."

    "section": "Basic Operations with Variables",
    "text": "Basic Operations with Variables\n\nWorking with Numbers: Integers and Floats\nAddition is one of the simplest operations. If you want to increase a value, you just add to it. For example, if you have a population measurement of 20000 and want to add 5000 more, Python gives you a new population number of 25000 like this:\n\npopulation = 20000  # current population of a town\n\nnew_population = population + 5000  # population increase after migration\n\nnew_population\n\n25000\n\n\nOther operations are just as simple. If you want to double a temperature value, you multiply it by 2 like this:\n\ntemperature = 4.5 \ndoubled_temp = temperature * 2\n\ndoubled_temp\n\n9.0\n\n\nDivision also works the same way: dividing 20000 by 100 gives 200.0 like this:\n\npopulation_ratio = population / 100\npopulation_ratio\n\n200.0\n\n\nPython can also handle exponents, like squaring numbers. If you want to find what 20000 times 20000 is, you can get it this way:\n\nsquared_population = population ** 2\nsquared_population\n\n400000000\n\n\nThis is useful for calculating things like squared distances or other exponential relationships.\n### Exercise 1: You are studying urban growth in a geography class. City A had a population of 1,500,000 people in the year 2000, and it grew to 2,100,000 people by the year 2020.\nYour task is to write a Python program that: - Stores the population values in variables. - Calculates how much the population has grown. - Displays the result using print().\n\npopulation_2000 = 1500000\npopulation_2020 = 2100000\ngrowth = population_2020 - population_2000\n\nprint(\"Population growth over 20 years:\", growth)\n\nPopulation growth over 20 years: 600000\n\n\n\npopulation_2000 = 1500000\npopulation_2020 = 2100000\n\ngrowth_percentage = ((population_2020 - population_2000) / population_2000) * 100\n\nprint(\"Population growth over 20 years: {:.2f}%\".format(growth_percentage))\n\nPopulation growth over 20 years: 40.00%\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Strings\nWith strings, one common thing we do is combine them, known as concatenation. Imagine you have two words, first name and last name, like “John” and “Doe”, and you want to make them into one full name: “John Doe.” You do this by placing them side by side with a plus sign between them, and Python combines them into one.\n\nfirst_name = 'John'\nlast_name = 'Doe'\nfull_name = first_name + \" \" + last_name\n\nfull_name\n\n'John Doe'\n\n\nAnother thing you can do with strings is repeat them. For instance, if you have the word “hello,” you could repeat it multiple times, like “hello hello hello” In Python, you simply tell it to multiply the word by the number of times you want it to appear like this:\n\necho = \" hello\" * 3\necho\n\n' hello hello hello'\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Booleans\nBooleans in Python are very straightforward: they represent only two options, True or False. They’re useful when you’re asking questions or checking if something meets certain conditions.\nFor example, let’s say you want to check if a town’s population is above a certain number. Imagine the town has a population of 20,000 people, and you want to know if it’s larger than 10,000:\n\npopulation = 20000  # current population of a town\n\nis_large_town = population &gt; 10000  # check if it's considered a large town\n\nis_large_town\n\nTrue\n\n\nWe can also ask Python to check multiple conditions at once. Maybe you want to know if a town has both a large population (over 10,000 people) and a low unemployment rate (under 5%). You can combine these two questions into one. If both are true, Python returns True; if either one isn’t, it returns False.\n\npopulation = 20000\nis_large = population &gt; 10000\n\nunemployment_rate = 4  # in percent\nis_low_unemployment = unemployment_rate &lt; 5\n\nis_large_and_stable = is_large and is_low_unemployment\nis_large_and_stable\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\nMixing Types Together\nSometimes, Python lets us mix different types in ways that make sense. For example, in Python, True is treated as 1 and False as 0. So if you’re working with a number and a condition, Python might add 1 if the condition is True, or add nothing if it’s False. This can be handy for quick adjustments, like slightly increasing a value if a condition is met.\nadjusted_population = population + is_low_unemployment adjusted_population\nThese simple operations let you do quite a bit in Python. With strings, you can create descriptive phrases; with numbers, you can add, multiply, and do more complex math; with booleans, you can check conditions and make decisions. This flexibility is what makes Python both powerful and beginner-friendly—it’s easy to write code that mimics real-world problem-solving, step by step."

    "section": "Data Structures",
    "text": "Data Structures\nData structures are essential for organizing and managing data in programming. In Python, we have several types of data structures, but three of the most commonly used ones are lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Each of these has unique characteristics and uses that make them suitable for different tasks.\n\nLists\nA list in Python is a collection of items that can be modified. This means you can add, remove, or change items in a list as needed. Lists are defined using square brackets []:\n\ngrades = [85.5, 90.2, 78.0, 88.5]  \ngrades  \n\n[85.5, 90.2, 78.0, 88.5]\n\n\nIn this example, we have a list called grades that stores test scores from different students.\n\nUsing Lists:\n1. Accessing Lists: Each item in a list has a position called an index, starting from 0. You can access any item using its index:\n\nfirst_grade = grades[0]\nfirst_grade\n\n85.5\n\n\n2. Modifying Items: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents:\n\ngrades[2] = 93.0\ngrades[2] \n\n93.0\n\n\n3. Adding Items: You can add new items to the end of a list using the append() method:\n\ngrades.append(65.0)\ngrades\n\n[85.5, 90.2, 93.0, 88.5, 65.0]\n\n\n4. Removing Items: You can remove items from a list using the remove() method or the pop() method:\n\ngrades.remove(65.0)\ngrades\n\n[85.5, 90.2, 93.0, 88.5]\n\n\n\ngrades.pop(0)\ngrades\n\n[90.2, 93.0, 88.5]\n\n\nConsider a scenario where you are recording student test scores for a class. You can store these scores in a list. As new test results come in, you can easily update the list by adding new scores or modifying existing ones.\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\nCreate a list named philosophers that contains these names as strings: “Plato”, “Aristotle”, “Confucius”, and “Socrates”.\nAdd the philosopher “Descartes” to the end of the list.\nRemove “Confucius” from the list.\nPrint the updated list to see the changes.\n\n\nphilosophers = [\"Plato\", \"Aristotle\", \"Confucius\", \"Socrates\"]\n\n# Add \"Descartes\" to the list\nphilosophers.append(\"Descartes\")\n\n# Remove \"Confucius\" from the list\n# Option 1:\n# philosophers.remove(\"Confucius\")\n\n# Option 2 (remove by index):\n# philosophers.pop(2)\n\nprint(philosophers)\n\n['Plato', 'Aristotle', 'Confucius', 'Socrates', 'Descartes']\n\n\n\n\nTuples\nA tuple is a collection of items, similar to a list, but it is immutable. This means that once a tuple is created, it cannot be changed. Tuples are defined using parentheses ().\n\ncoordinates = (47.5, -52.3) \ncoordinates\n\n(47.5, -52.3)\n\n\nThis tuple represents the geographic coordinates of a specific location.\n\nUsing Tuples:\n1. Accessing Items: Just like lists, you can access items in a tuple using their index:\n\nlatitude = coordinates[0]\nlatitude\n\n47.5\n\n\n\ncoordinates[0] = 48.5\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[68], line 1\n----&gt; 1 coordinates[0] = 48.5\n\nTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n\n\n\n2. Benefits of Immutability: Since tuples cannot be changed, they are useful for storing fixed data that should not be altered. This can help prevent accidental changes to important values.\nIn oceanography, you might want to store the coordinates of a specific research station. Since these coordinates are fixed and won’t change, a tuple is the ideal choice. If you need to reference these coordinates later in your code, you can do so confidently, knowing they will not change.\n\n\n\nDictionaries\nA dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs, similar to how a real dictionary has words (keys) and their meanings (values). Each key in a dictionary must be unique, and you can use it to access its corresponding value. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {}.\n\nstudent_data = {  \n    \"name\": \"Alex Johnson\",  \n    \"age\": 20,  \n    \"grade\": 88.5,  \n    \"major\": \"Computer Science\"  \n}  \nstudent_data  \n\n{'name': 'Alex Johnson', 'age': 20, 'grade': 88.5, 'major': 'Computer Science'}\n\n\nIn this example, we have a dictionary called student_data that stores various pieces of information about a student’s academic details.\n\nUsing Dictionaries:\n1. Accessing Values: You can retrieve a value using its corresponding key.\n\ncurrent_grade = student_data[\"grade\"]  \ncurrent_grade  \n\n88.5\n\n\n2. Adding or Modifying Values: You can easily add new key-value pairs or modify existing ones:\n\n#Modify Existing one\nstudent_data[\"grade\"] = 92.0  \nstudent_data  \n\n{'name': 'Alex Johnson', 'age': 20, 'grade': 92.0, 'major': 'Computer Science'}\n\n\n\n#Adding new key-value pair\nstudent_data[\"attendance\"] = 95  \nstudent_data  \n\n{'name': 'Alex Johnson',\n 'age': 20,\n 'grade': 92.0,\n 'major': 'Computer Science',\n 'attendance': 95}\n\n\n3. Removing Key-Value Pairs: You can remove a key-value pair using the del statement:\n\ndel student_data[\"major\"]  \nstudent_data  \n\n{'name': 'Alex Johnson', 'age': 20, 'grade': 92.0, 'attendance': 95}\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\nCreate a dictionary named countries with these key-value pairs:\n\n\n“United States” : “English”\n“Mexico” : “Spanish”\n“France” : “French”\n“Canada” : “English and French”\n\n\nAdd a new entry to the dictionary: “Brazil” : “Portuguese”\nRemove the key “France” and its value using the del statement.\nPrint the updated dictionary every time.\n\n\ncountries = {\n    \"United States\": \"English\",\n    \"Mexico\": \"Spanish\",\n    \"France\": \"French\",\n    \"Canada\": \"English and French\"\n}\n\nprint(countries)\n\n# Add Brazil\ncountries[\"Brazil\"] = \"Portuguese\"\nprint(countries)\n\n# Remove France using del\ndel countries[\"France\"]\n\nprint(countries)\n\n{'United States': 'English', 'Mexico': 'Spanish', 'France': 'French', 'Canada': 'English and French'}\n{'United States': 'English', 'Mexico': 'Spanish', 'France': 'French', 'Canada': 'English and French', 'Brazil': 'Portuguese'}\n{'United States': 'English', 'Mexico': 'Spanish', 'Canada': 'English and French', 'Brazil': 'Portuguese'}\n\n\n\nChoosing the Right Data Structure\nSelecting the appropriate data structure is crucial. Here’s a quick guide:\n\nUse Lists when you need to store a collection of items that you might want to change or add to, like student grades over multiple subjects or assignments.\nUse Tuples for fixed data points that won’t change, such as geographic coordinates of research locations.\nUse Dictionaries when you need to associate related information together, such as all academic details for a specific student.\n\nChoosing the right data structure will make your data management more efficient and your code easier to understand."

    "text": "Control Structures\nControl structures are essential programming constructs that allow us to dictate the flow of our program. In Python, the most commonly used control structures include loops (for and while) and conditionals (if and else). These structures enable us to repeat actions, make decisions based on conditions, and manage how we process data.\n\nConditionals\nConditionals allow us to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. This means that our program can make decisions and act differently depending on the situation. The most common conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else.\n\nBasic Structure of Conditionals:\nHere’s a simple structure for using conditionals:\nif condition: # Code to execute if the condition is true elif another_condition: # Code to execute if the first condition is false and this one is true else: # Code to execute if both conditions are false\n\n\nComparison Operators\nComparison operators allow us to compare two values. Here are the most commonly used comparison operators in Python:\n==: Equal to (checks if two values are the same) !=: Not equal to (checks if two values are different) &gt;: Greater than (checks if the left value is larger than the right) &lt;: Less than (checks if the left value is smaller than the right) &gt;=: Greater than or equal to (checks if the left value is larger than or equal to the right) &lt;=: Less than or equal to (checks if the left value is smaller than or equal to the right)\nLet’s say we want to categorize towns based on their population size:\n\npopulation = 20000\n\nif population &lt; 5000:\n    print(\"Small town\")\nelif 5000 &lt;= population &lt;= 20000:\n    print(\"Medium-sized town\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Large town\")\n\nMedium-sized town\n\n\nIn this example:\n\nIf the population is less than 5,000, it prints “Small town.”\nIf the population is between 5,000 and 20,000 (inclusive), it prints “Medium-sized town.”\nIf the population is over 20,000, it prints “Large town.”\n\n\n\nLogical Operators\nLogical operators allow us to combine multiple conditions. The most commonly used logical operators are:\n\nand: Returns True if both conditions are true.\nor: Returns True if at least one condition is true.\nnot: Reverses the truth value (makes True become False and vice versa).\n\nLet’s say we want to check if someone’s annual income falls within the middle-income bracket:\n\nannual_income = 45000\n\nif annual_income &gt;= 30000 and annual_income &lt;= 70000:\n    print(\"Middle-income bracket\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Outside middle-income bracket\")\n\nMiddle-income bracket\n\n\nIn this example:\n\nThe condition annual_income &gt;= 30000 and annual_income &lt;= 70000 checks if the income is between 30,000 and 70,000 inclusive.\nIf both are true, it prints “Middle-income bracket.”\n\n\n\n\nLoops\nLoops allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times. This is especially useful when we have to process a collection of items, like a list of temperature readings or salinity measurements. The two primary types of loops in Python are for loops and while loops.\n\nFor Loops:\nA for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or a tuple). Here’s the basic structure:\nfor item in sequence: # Code to execute for each item\nLet’s say we want to print out each survey response score from a list:\n\nsurvey_scores = [3, 4, 5, 2, 4]\n\nfor score in survey_scores:\n    print(f\"Survey score: {score} out of 5\")\nscore\n\nSurvey score: 3 out of 5\nSurvey score: 4 out of 5\nSurvey score: 5 out of 5\nSurvey score: 2 out of 5\nSurvey score: 4 out of 5\n\n\n4\n\n\nIn this example, the loop goes through each item in the survey_scores list and prints it.\nFor loops are useful for analyzing data, such as calculating the average monthly income from several months:\n\nmonthly_incomes = [3000, 3200, 3100, 2900, 4000, 3500, 2500, 2900, 3050, 3200, 3500, 2950]\ntotal_income = 0\n\nfor income in monthly_incomes:\n    total_income += income\n\naverage_income = total_income / len(monthly_incomes)\nprint(f\"Average Monthly Income: ${average_income:.2f}\")\n\nAverage Monthly Income: $3150.00\n\n\nIn this case, the loop adds up all the monthly incomes and then finds the average by dividing by the number of months.\n\n\n\nExercise 4\n\nYou are given a list named populations that contains population numbers (in thousands).\nUse a for loop to add all the population numbers together and store the total in a variable called total_population.\nCalculate the average population by dividing the total population.\nPrint the average population rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\n\npopulations = [2731, 631, 1135, 934, 1705]\n\ntotal_population = 0\n\nfor pop in populations:\n    total_population += pop\n\naverage_population = total_population / len(populations)\n\nprint(\"Average population (in thousands):\", round(average_population))\n\nAverage population (in thousands): 1427\n\n\n\nWhile Loops\nA while loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true. The basic structure looks like this:\nwhile condition: # Code to execute while the condition is true\nLet’s say we want to keep recording monthly expenses until we have data for five months:\n\nmonthly_expenses = []\nmax_months = 5\n\nwhile len(monthly_expenses) &lt; max_months:\n    new_expense = float(input(\"Enter monthly expense amount: \"))\n    monthly_expenses.append(new_expense)\n\nprint(\"Monthly expenses collected:\", monthly_expenses)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStdinNotImplementedError                  Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[80], line 5\n      2 max_months = 5\n      4 while len(monthly_expenses) &lt; max_months:\n----&gt; 5     new_expense = float(input(\"Enter monthly expense amount: \"))\n      6     monthly_expenses.append(new_expense)\n      8 print(\"Monthly expenses collected:\", monthly_expenses)\n\nFile /usr/lib/python3.13/site-packages/ipykernel/kernelbase.py:1281, in Kernel.raw_input(self, prompt)\n   1279 if not self._allow_stdin:\n   1280     msg = \"raw_input was called, but this frontend does not support input requests.\"\n-&gt; 1281     raise StdinNotImplementedError(msg)\n   1282 return self._input_request(\n   1283     str(prompt),\n   1284     self._parent_ident[\"shell\"],\n   1285     self.get_parent(\"shell\"),\n   1286     password=False,\n   1287 )\n\nStdinNotImplementedError: raw_input was called, but this frontend does not support input requests.\n\n\n\nIn this example, the loop keeps asking for monthly expenses until it has collected five amounts.\nWhile loops are useful for continuous data collection, like tracking monthly donations until reaching a target amount:\n\ndonations = 0\n\nwhile donations &lt; 5000:\n    donations += 500\n    print(f\"Total Donations Collected: ${donations}\")\n\nTotal Donations Collected: $500\nTotal Donations Collected: $1000\nTotal Donations Collected: $1500\nTotal Donations Collected: $2000\nTotal Donations Collected: $2500\nTotal Donations Collected: $3000\nTotal Donations Collected: $3500\nTotal Donations Collected: $4000\nTotal Donations Collected: $4500\nTotal Donations Collected: $5000\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining Loops and Conditionals\nOften, we will need to use both loops and conditionals together to process data effectively. For example, you might want to analyze temperature readings and categorize them within a loop.\nLet’s categorize a list of temperature readings as “Cold,” “Warm,” or “Hot”:\n\ntemperature_readings = [10.0, 20.5, 25.0, 30.5]\n\nfor temperature in temperature_readings:\n    if temperature &lt; 15:\n        print(f\"Temperature {temperature} C: Cold\")\n    elif 15 &lt;= temperature &lt;=25:\n        print(f\"Temperature {temperature} C: Warm\")\n    else: \n        print(f\"Temperature {temperature} C: Hot\")\n\nTemperature 10.0 C: Cold\nTemperature 20.5 C: Warm\nTemperature 25.0 C: Warm\nTemperature 30.5 C: Hot\n\n\nIn this example, the loop goes through each temperature reading, and the conditional statements categorize each temperature accordingly.\nNow, let’s say we want to use a loop to analyze data stored in a dictionary. We have a dictionary of historical events and the years they happened. Using a for loop, we can go through each event and year, and use a control structure like an if statement to check whether the event happened before or after 1900.\n\nevents = {\n    \"Signing of the Magna Carta\": 1215,\n    \"French Revolution\": 1789,\n    \"Moon Landing\": 1969,\n    \"Canadian Confederation\": 1867,\n    \"Fall of the Berlin Wall\": 1989\n}\n\nfor event, year in events.items():\n    print(event)\n    \n    if year &lt; 1900:\n        print(\"This event happened before 1900.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(\"This event happened in or after 1900.\\n\")\n\nSigning of the Magna Carta\nThis event happened before 1900.\n\nFrench Revolution\nThis event happened before 1900.\n\nMoon Landing\nThis event happened in or after 1900.\n\nCanadian Confederation\nThis event happened before 1900.\n\nFall of the Berlin Wall\nThis event happened in or after 1900.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nYou are given a dictionary of universities worldwide with their average graduation rates (in percentages):\nuniversities = { “Harvard University”: 98,\n\"University of Oxford\": 92,\n\n\"Stanford University\": 94,\n\n\"Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\": 92,\n\n\"University of Cambridge\": 93,\n\n\"University of Tokyo\": 70,\n\n\"University of Melbourne\": 79,\n\n\"University of Cape Town\": 68,\n\n\"University of São Paulo\": 65,\n\n\"National University of Singapore\": 80\n}\nTask:\n\nLoop through each university and its graduation rate.\nPrint the university name and its graduation rate.\nUse conditional statements to classify the graduation rate:\n\n90% or above: print “Excellent graduation rate”.\nBetween 75% and 89% (inclusive): print “Good graduation rate”.\nBelow 75%: print “Needs improvement”.\n\n\n\nuniversities = {\n    \"Harvard University\": 98,\n    \"University of Oxford\": 92,\n    \"Stanford University\": 94,\n    \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\": 92,\n    \"University of Cambridge\": 93,\n    \"University of Tokyo\": 70,\n    \"University of Melbourne\": 79,\n    \"University of Cape Town\": 68,\n    \"University of São Paulo\": 65,\n    \"National University of Singapore\": 80\n}\n\nfor university, rate in universities.items():\n    print(university + \" has a graduation rate of \" + str(rate) + \"%.\")\n    \n    if rate &gt;= 90:\n        print(\"Excellent graduation rate\\n\")\n    elif 75 &lt;= rate &lt; 90:\n        print(\"Good graduation rate\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Needs improvement\\n\")\n\nHarvard University has a graduation rate of 98%.\nExcellent graduation rate\n\nUniversity of Oxford has a graduation rate of 92%.\nExcellent graduation rate\n\nStanford University has a graduation rate of 94%.\nExcellent graduation rate\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has a graduation rate of 92%.\nExcellent graduation rate\n\nUniversity of Cambridge has a graduation rate of 93%.\nExcellent graduation rate\n\nUniversity of Tokyo has a graduation rate of 70%.\nNeeds improvement\n\nUniversity of Melbourne has a graduation rate of 79%.\nGood graduation rate\n\nUniversity of Cape Town has a graduation rate of 68%.\nNeeds improvement\n\nUniversity of São Paulo has a graduation rate of 65%.\nNeeds improvement\n\nNational University of Singapore has a graduation rate of 80%.\nGood graduation rate"

in the morning concentrates a man's mind wonderfully; unfortunately, what the mind inevitably concentrates on is that, in the morning, it will be in a body that is going to be hanged.\nThe man going to be hanged had been named Moist von Lipwig by doting if unwise parents, but he was not going to embarrass the name, insofar as that was still possible, by being hung under it. To the world in general, and particularly on that bit of it known as the death warrant, he was Alfred Spangler.\nAnd he took a more positive approach to the situation and had concentrated his mind on the prospect of not being hanged in the morning, and, most particularly, on the prospect of removing all the crumbling mortar from around a stone in his cell wall with a spoon. So far the work had taken him five weeks and reduced the spoon to something like a nail file. Fortunately, no one ever came to change the bedding here, or else they would have discovered the world's heaviest mattress.\nIt was a large and heavy stone that was currently the object of his attentions, and, at some point, a huge staple had been hammered into it as an anchor for manacles.\nMoist sat down facing the wall, gripped the iron ring in both hands, braced his legs against the stones on either side, and heaved.\nHis shoulders caught fire, and a red mist filled his vision, but the block slid out with a faint and inappropriate tinkling noise. Moist managed to ease it away from the hole and peered inside.\nAt the far end was another block, and the mortar around it looked suspiciously strong and fresh.\nJust in front of it was a new spoon. It was shiny.\nAs he studied it, he heard the clapping behind him. He turned his head, tendons twanging a little riff of agony, and saw several of the wardens watching him through the bars.\n\"Well done, Mr. Spangler!\" said one of them. \"Ron here owes me five dollars! I told him you were a sticker!! 'He's a sticker,' I said!\"\n\"You set this up, did you, Mr. Wilkinson?\" said Moist weakly, watching the glint of light on the spoon.\n\"Oh, not us, sir. Lord Vetinari's orders. He insists that all condemned prisoners should be offered the prospect of freedom.\"\n\"Freedom? But there's a damn great stone through there!\"\n\"Yes, there is that, sir, yes, there is that,\" said the warden. \"It's only the prospect, you see. Not actual free freedom as such. Hah, that'd be a bit daft, eh?\"\n\"I suppose so, yes,\" said Moist. He didn't say \"you bastards.\" The wardens had treated him quite civilly these past six weeks, and he made a point of getting on with people. He was very, very good at it. People skills were part of his stock-in-trade; they were nearly the whole of it.\nBesides, these people had big sticks. So, speaking carefully, he added: \"Some people might consider this cruel, Mr. Wilkinson.\"\n\"Yes, sir, we asked him about that, sir, but he said no, it wasn't. He said it provided\"--his forehead wrinkled \"--occ-you-pay-shun-all ther-rap-py, healthy exercise, prevented moping, and offered that greatest of all treasures, which is Hope, sir.\"\n\"Hope,\" muttered Moist glumly.\n\"Not upset, are you, sir?\"\n\"Upset? Why should I be upset, Mr. Wilkinson?\"\n\"Only the last bloke we had in this cell, he managed to get down that drain, sir. Very small man.

    "text": "Introduction to JupyterLab\nJupyterLab is an interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is commonly used in data science, research, and education, especially for projects in the Digital Humanities, because of its flexibility and ease of use. JupyterLab is essentially an upgrade of Jupyter Notebooks, providing a more modular and feature-rich interface.\n\nKey Features of JupyterLab:\n\nCode cells: These are cells where you write and execute code.\nMarkdown cells: These cells are used for explanatory text, formatted using Markdown.\nRich outputs: Visualizations, graphs, images, and other media can be displayed inline within the notebook.\nFile management: JupyterLab has a built-in file browser that allows you to organize and manage notebooks, text files, images, and other resources.\n\n\n\nHow to Add Cells in JupyterLab\nIn JupyterLab, cells are the building blocks of your notebook. You can add, delete, and modify cells to create a flow between code execution and explanatory text.\n\nAdding Cells:\n\nVia Menu: Navigate to the top menu: Insert → Insert Cell Below or Insert → Insert Cell Above.\nKeyboard Shortcuts: Press B to insert a cell below the current one or A to insert a cell above.\nClicking Buttons: Use the “+” button in the toolbar to insert new cells.\n\n\n\nSwitching Between Cell Types (Code and Markdown):\nYou can switch between code cells and markdown cells to organize your content effectively.\n\nTo Change a Cell Type to Code:\n\n\nSelect the cell and press Y.\nAlternatively, click on the Cell Type dropdown menu in the toolbar (where “Markdown” is by default) and select Code.\n\n\nTo Change a Cell Type to Markdown:\n\n\nSelect the cell and press M.\nAlternatively, use the Cell Type dropdown and select Markdown.\n\nThis allows you to seamlessly switch between running code and writing descriptive text.\n\n\nRunning and Stopping Cells\nCells in JupyterLab can either be run (executed) or stopped, depending on whether you want to see the result of the code.\n\nRunning Cells: To execute a cell, you can:\n\n\nWindows/Linux: Press Shift + Enter to run the current cell and move to the next.\nMac: Press Shift + Enter to run the current cell and move to the next. You can also use command + Enter to run the cell and stay in that cell.\nAlternatively, click the Run button in the toolbar.\n\n\nStopping a Cell: If you want to stop the execution of a cell:\n\n\nNavigate to Kernel → Interrupt in the top menu or use the Stop button in the toolbar.\nAlternatively, use the keyboard shortcut I twice (press I quickly two times) to interrupt the current execution.\n\n\n\n\nThe Kernel in JupyterLab\nThe kernel is the engine behind your notebook, it runs your Python code and remembers what you’ve done.\nWhen you press Shift + Enter to run a cell, the kernel executes that code and gives you a result (a number, a list, a graph, etc.).\n\nUnderstanding [ ], [*], and [1] in Jupyter Cells\nEvery time you run a code cell, you’ll see a number appear inside square brackets next to the cell, like this:\n\nprint(\"Hello\")\n\nHello\n\n\nHere’s what those brackets mean:\n[ ] — The cell has not been run yet.\n[*] — The code is currently running (kernel is busy).\n[1], [2], … — The number shows the order in which you ran the cells.\nFor example:\nIf you see [5] next to a cell, it means this was the fifth cell you ran.\nIf a cell is stuck on [*], it might be taking a long time or be stuck — you can stop it using Kernel → Interrupt.\n\n\nCommon Kernel Actions:\n\nRun code: Shift + Enter\nInterrupt kernel: Stop a running cell (especially useful if stuck on [*])\nRestart kernel: Clears everything the kernel remembers (variables, imports, etc.)\n\nUse Kernel → Restart if things get messy or confusing — then rerun your cells from the top to start fresh."

    "text": "Built-in Functions and Documentation\nPython provides a wide range of built-in functions—these are standard, preloaded tools that help with common tasks. They require no additional libraries or installations and are available immediately when you run Python.\n\nWhat Are Built-in Functions?\nA built-in function is a function that is always available in Python. These are designed to simplify common programming tasks. For instance, rather than writing your own code to calculate the length of a string, you can use len().\nBuilt-in functions improve productivity and reduce the need for writing code from scratch for basic operations.\n\n\nCommon Built-in Functions and What They Do:\n\nprint(): Displays text or variable output.\nlen(): Returns the number of items in an object (string, list, etc.).\ntype(): Returns the data type of a variable (e.g., int, str).\nint(), float(), str(): Convert between data types.\nrange(): Produces a sequence of numbers, often used in loops.\nsum(): Adds numbers in a list or iterable.\nsorted(): Returns a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.\nmax() / min(): Finds the largest or smallest value in a dataset.\n\n\n# Example 1: Basic text output\nprint(\"Welcome to Digital Humanities\")\n\n# Example 2: Working with a string\nsentence = \"Humanities meet computation\"\nprint(\"Length of sentence:\", len(sentence))\n\n# Example 3: Check data type\nnumber = 42\nprint(\"Data type:\", type(number))\n\n# Example 4: Sorting a list\nyears = [1850, 2023, 1945, 1789]\nprint(\"Sorted years:\", sorted(years))\n\n# Example 5: Using range and sum\nprint(\"Sum from 1 to 5:\", sum(range(1, 6)))  # 1+2+3+4+5 = 15\n\nWelcome to Digital Humanities\nLength of sentence: 27\nData type: &lt;class 'int'&gt;\nSorted years: [1789, 1850, 1945, 2023]\nSum from 1 to 5: 15\n\n\n\n\nExploring Python Documentation\nLearning how to explore the documentation is key to becoming self-sufficient in Python.\nPython provides tools for this: - help() function - The ? syntax in Jupyter Notebooks\n\nhelp(str)\n\nHelp on class str in module builtins:\n\nclass str(object)\n |  str(object='') -&gt; str\n |  str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -&gt; str\n |\n |  Create a new string object from the given object.

They’re always available whenever you run Python, making it super convenient to perform many common programming tasks right out of the box.\n\nrandom : Generate random numbers\nUseful for creating random data, games, simulations, or selecting random elements.\n\nimport random\nprint(random.randint(1, 10))  # Random number between 1 and 10\n\n10\n\n\n\n\ndatetime — Work with dates and times\nEasily get the current date/time or perform date calculations.\n\nimport datetime\nnow = datetime.datetime.now()\nprint(now.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n\n2025-06-03 09:30:37\n\n\n\n\nos — Interact with your computer’s operating system\nGet info about files, directories, environment variables, or execute system commands.\n\nimport os\n\nprint(os.getcwd())  # Current working directory\nprint(os.listdir()) # List files in the current directory\n\n/home/marie/parvus/prog/dhsi/2025_dhsi/monday\n['day1_afternoon_completed.quarto_ipynb', '.jupyter_cache', 'index.qmd', 'day1_afternoon.ipynb', 'day1_afternoon_completed.qmd', 'wb_hss_prog_slides.qmd', 'day1_afternoon_completed.ipynb', 'day1_afternoon.qmd']\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal Libraries\nWhile Python’s built-in libraries cover a lot, many advanced tasks require specialized tools, this is where external libraries come in. These are packages developed by the Python community (or companies) and shared through the Python Package Index (PyPI). You usually install them using the package manager pip.\n\nWhat Are External Libraries?\n\nThey extend Python’s capabilities beyond the standard library.\nProvide tools for data science, machine learning, web development, image processing, automation, and much more.\nThey often come with many modules and sub-packages bundled together, making them powerful libraries.\n\n\n\nInstalling External Libraries\nNormally, you install external libraries using the command line:\npip install library-name\nFor example:\npip install numpy pip install pandas pip install matplotlib\nMost popular external libraries used for data science and scientific computing come pre-installed in JupyterLab environments such as: - Anaconda distribution (a popular Python distribution for data science) - Cloud platforms like Google Colab - Many managed JupyterHub setups\nThis means when you open a notebook in JupyterLab, you can often import and use libraries like numpy, pandas, and matplotlib immediately, no extra installation required.\nLet’s see some examples of these libraries:\n\n\nnumpy — Fast numerical computing\nProvides powerful arrays and mathematical functions.\n\nimport numpy as np\n\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3])\nprint(arr * 2)  # [2 4 6]\n\n[2 4 6]\n\n\n\n\npandas — Data manipulation and analysis\nMakes working with tabular data easy.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob'], 'Age': [25, 30]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\nprint(df)\n\n    Name  Age\n0  Alice   25\n1    Bob   30\n\n\n\n\nmatplotlib — Data visualization\nCreate charts and graphs.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4]\ny = [10, 20, 25, 30]\n\nplt.plot(x, y)\nplt.title(\"Simple Line Plot\")\nplt.show()"

    "text": "Introduction to JupyterLab\nJupyterLab is an interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is commonly used in data science, research, and education, especially for projects in the Digital Humanities, because of its flexibility and ease of use. JupyterLab is essentially an upgrade of Jupyter Notebooks, providing a more modular and feature-rich interface.\n\nKey Features of JupyterLab:\n\nCode cells: These are cells where you write and execute code.\nMarkdown cells: These cells are used for explanatory text, formatted using Markdown.\nRich outputs: Visualizations, graphs, images, and other media can be displayed inline within the notebook.\nFile management: JupyterLab has a built-in file browser that allows you to organize and manage notebooks, text files, images, and other resources.\n\n\n\nHow to Add Cells in JupyterLab\nIn JupyterLab, cells are the building blocks of your notebook. You can add, delete, and modify cells to create a flow between code execution and explanatory text.\n\nAdding Cells:\n\nVia Menu: Navigate to the top menu: Insert → Insert Cell Below or Insert → Insert Cell Above.\nKeyboard Shortcuts: Press B to insert a cell below the current one or A to insert a cell above.\nClicking Buttons: Use the “+” button in the toolbar to insert new cells.\n\n\n\nSwitching Between Cell Types (Code and Markdown):\nYou can switch between code cells and markdown cells to organize your content effectively.\n\nTo Change a Cell Type to Code:\n\n\nSelect the cell and press Y.\nAlternatively, click on the Cell Type dropdown menu in the toolbar (where “Markdown” is by default) and select Code.\n\n\nTo Change a Cell Type to Markdown:\n\n\nSelect the cell and press M.\nAlternatively, use the Cell Type dropdown and select Markdown.\n\nThis allows you to seamlessly switch between running code and writing descriptive text.\n\n\nRunning and Stopping Cells\nCells in JupyterLab can either be run (executed) or stopped, depending on whether you want to see the result of the code.\n\nRunning Cells: To execute a cell, you can:\n\n\nWindows/Linux: Press Shift + Enter to run the current cell and move to the next.\nMac: Press Shift + Enter to run the current cell and move to the next. You can also use command + Enter to run the cell and stay in that cell.\nAlternatively, click the Run button in the toolbar.\n\n\nStopping a Cell: If you want to stop the execution of a cell:\n\n\nNavigate to Kernel → Interrupt in the top menu or use the Stop button in the toolbar.\nAlternatively, use the keyboard shortcut I twice (press I quickly two times) to interrupt the current execution.\n\n\n\n\nThe Kernel in JupyterLab\nThe kernel is the engine behind your notebook, it runs your Python code and remembers what you’ve done.\nWhen you press Shift + Enter to run a cell, the kernel executes that code and gives you a result (a number, a list, a graph, etc.).\n\nUnderstanding [ ], [*], and [1] in Jupyter Cells\nEvery time you run a code cell, you’ll see a number appear inside square brackets next to the cell, like this:\n\n#Your code goes here\n\nHere’s what those brackets mean:\n[ ] — The cell has not been run yet.\n[*] — The code is currently running (kernel is busy).\n[1], [2], … — The number shows the order in which you ran the cells.\nFor example:\nIf you see [5] next to a cell, it means this was the fifth cell you ran.\nIf a cell is stuck on [*], it might be taking a long time or be stuck — you can stop it using Kernel → Interrupt.\n\n\nCommon Kernel Actions:\n\nRun code: Shift + Enter\nInterrupt kernel: Stop a running cell (especially useful if stuck on [*])\nRestart kernel: Clears everything the kernel remembers (variables, imports, etc.)\n\nUse Kernel → Restart if things get messy or confusing — then rerun your cells from the top to start fresh."

They require no additional libraries or installations and are available immediately when you run Python.\n\nWhat Are Built-in Functions?\nA built-in function is a function that is always available in Python. These are designed to simplify common programming tasks. For instance, rather than writing your own code to calculate the length of a string, you can use len().\nBuilt-in functions improve productivity and reduce the need for writing code from scratch for basic operations.\n\n\nCommon Built-in Functions and What They Do:\n\nprint(): Displays text or variable output.\nlen(): Returns the number of items in an object (string, list, etc.).\ntype(): Returns the data type of a variable (e.g., int, str).\nint(), float(), str(): Convert between data types.\nrange(): Produces a sequence of numbers, often used in loops.\nsum(): Adds numbers in a list or iterable.\nsorted(): Returns a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.\nmax() / min(): Finds the largest or smallest value in a dataset.\n\n\n# Example 1: Basic text output\n#Your code goes here\n\n# Example 2: Working with a string\n#Your code goes here\n\n# Example 3: Check data type\n#Your code goes here\n\n# Example 4: Sorting a list\n#Your code goes here\n\n# Example 5: Using range and sum\n#Your code goes here\n\n\n\nExploring Python Documentation\nLearning how to explore the documentation is key to becoming self-sufficient in Python.\nPython provides tools for this: - help() function - The ? syntax in Jupyter Notebooks\n\n#Your code goes here\n\nThis gives detailed information about how to work with strings.\n\n#Your code goes here\n\nThis brings up a quick help popup describing the str class.\nYou can also combine help with other functions:\n\n#Your code goes here\n\nThis shows how the len() function works and what types it supports."

    "text": "Before we jump into analyzing data, let’s talk about one of the most powerful tools in programming: variables. Think of a variable like a storage box where you can put information that you might want to use later. This is how we make computers remember things for us!\nLet’s start with something simple. Imagine using Python like a calculator. You can do quick math, like this:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nThis is very handy, but let’s be honest, it’s not very exciting. What makes programming powerful is the ability to store this result or any other data, and use it again whenever we need it. That’s where variables come in.\n\n\nA variable is a name that refers to a value. In the previous example, we saw that we can use Python as an advanced calculator. However, the results of these computations are lost after we perform our operations. If we want to save and reuse any value in a code, we need to save these computations in a place in computer memory to be able to access it in the future.\nVariables are names that we associate with a memory location in computers. As such variables are not values themselves but they point to a memory location where the actual values are stored.\n\n#your code goes here\n\nNow, Python will remember that weight_kg equals 60. Instead of doing the math all over again or writing the number repeatedly, we just use weight_kg whenever we need it.\nA Few Rules for Naming Variables: - You can use letters, digits, and **underscores (_), but the name can’t** start with a digit. - Variable names are case-sensitive, so weight and Weight are two different things.\nFor example: - weight0 is valid, but 0weight isn’t. - weight_kg is different from Weight_kg.\n\n\n\nPython can work with different types of data. Three of the most common types are:\n\nIntegers (whole numbers like 1, 2, 100)\nFloating point numbers (numbers with decimals like 2.5, 60.3)\nStrings (text like “Hello”, “001”)\nBooleans (True or False)\n\nFor example, let’s say we want to store a patient’s weight. If the weight is exactly 60 kilograms, we can use an integer:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nBut if we want to be more precise, like 60.3 kilograms, we can use a floating point number:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nHere, weight_kg is a variable that stores a decimal number, or a float. It could represent any weight in kg measurement, which we might later use for calculations or comparisons.\nWe can also store text:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nStrings can store text data, which can be useful for labeling or adding metadata.\nAnd lastly, we have booleans, which are used to represent true or false values. They are helpful in logical operations or conditions:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nWith this variable, we could decide whether to apply certain calculations or adjustments based on the height. It can help us write cleaner, more conditional code."

If the weight is exactly 60 kilograms, we can use an integer:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nBut if we want to be more precise, like 60.3 kilograms, we can use a floating point number:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nHere, weight_kg is a variable that stores a decimal number, or a float. It could represent any weight in kg measurement, which we might later use for calculations or comparisons.\nWe can also store text:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nStrings can store text data, which can be useful for labeling or adding metadata.\nAnd lastly, we have booleans, which are used to represent true or false values. They are helpful in logical operations or conditions:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nWith this variable, we could decide whether to apply certain calculations or adjustments based on the height. It can help us write cleaner, more conditional code."

    "text": "Basic Operations with Variables\n\nWorking with Numbers: Integers and Floats\nAddition is one of the simplest operations. If you want to increase a value, you just add to it. For example, if you have a population measurement of 20000 and want to add 5000 more, Python gives you a new population number of 25000 like this:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nOther operations are just as simple. If you want to double a temperature value, you multiply it by 2 like this:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nDivision also works the same way: dividing 20000 by 100 gives 200.0 like this:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nPython can also handle exponents, like squaring numbers. If you want to find what 20000 times 20000 is, you can get it this way:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nThis is useful for calculating things like squared distances or other exponential relationships.\n### Exercise 1: You are studying urban growth in a geography class. City A had a population of 1,500,000 people in the year 2000, and it grew to 2,100,000 people by the year 2020.\nYour task is to write a Python program that: - Stores the population values in variables. - Calculates how much the population has grown. - Displays the result using print().\n\n#your code goes here\n\n\n\nWorking with Strings\nWith strings, one common thing we do is combine them, known as concatenation. Imagine you have two words, first name and last name, like “John” and “Doe”, and you want to make them into one full name: “John Doe.” You do this by placing them side by side with a plus sign between them, and Python combines them into one.\n\n#your code goes here\n\nAnother thing you can do with strings is repeat them. For instance, if you have the word “hello,” you could repeat it multiple times, like “hello hello hello” In Python, you simply tell it to multiply the word by the number of times you want it to appear like this:\n\n#your code goes here\n\n\n\nWorking with Booleans\nBooleans in Python are very straightforward: they represent only two options, True or False. They’re useful when you’re asking questions or checking if something meets certain conditions.\nFor example, let’s say you want to check if a town’s population is above a certain number. Imagine the town has a population of 20,000 people, and you want to know if it’s larger than 10,000:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nWe can also ask Python to check multiple conditions at once. Maybe you want to know if a town has both a large population (over 10,000 people) and a low unemployment rate (under 5%). You can combine these two questions into one. If both are true, Python returns True; if either one isn’t, it returns False.\n\n#your code goes here\n\n\n\nMixing Types Together\nSometimes, Python lets us mix different types in ways that make sense. For example, in Python, True is treated as 1 and False as 0. So if you’re working with a number and a condition, Python might add 1 if the condition is True, or add nothing if it’s False. This can be handy for quick adjustments, like slightly increasing a value if a condition is met.\n\n#your code goes here\n\nThese simple operations let you do quite a bit in Python. With strings, you can create descriptive phrases; with numbers, you can add, multiply, and do more complex math; with booleans, you can check conditions and make decisions. This flexibility is what makes Python both powerful and beginner-friendly—it’s easy to write code that mimics real-world problem-solving, step by step."

    "title": "Introductory Programming with Python",
    "section": "Data Structures",
    "text": "Data Structures\nData structures are essential for organizing and managing data in programming. In Python, we have several types of data structures, but three of the most commonly used ones are lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Each of these has unique characteristics and uses that make them suitable for different tasks.\n\nLists\nA list in Python is a collection of items that can be modified. This means you can add, remove, or change items in a list as needed. Lists are defined using square brackets []:\n\n#your code goes here  \n\nIn this example, we have a list called grades that stores test scores from different students.\n\nUsing Lists:\n1. Accessing Lists: Each item in a list has a position called an index, starting from 0. You can access any item using its index:\n\n#your code goes here\n\n2. Modifying Items: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents:\n\n#your code goes here\n\n3. Adding Items: You can add new items to the end of a list using the append() method:\n\n#your code goes here\n\n4. Removing Items: You can remove items from a list using the remove() method or the pop() method:\n\n#your code goes here\n\n\n#your code goes here\n\nConsider a scenario where you are recording student test scores for a class. You can store these scores in a list. As new test results come in, you can easily update the list by adding new scores or modifying existing ones.\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\nCreate a list named philosophers that contains these names as strings: “Plato”, “Aristotle”, “Confucius”, and “Socrates”.\nAdd the philosopher “Descartes” to the end of the list.\nRemove “Confucius” from the list.\nPrint the updated list to see the changes.\n\n\n#your code goes here\n\n\n\nTuples\nA tuple is a collection of items, similar to a list, but it is immutable. This means that once a tuple is created, it cannot be changed. Tuples are defined using parentheses ().\n\n#your code goes here\n\nThis tuple represents the geographic coordinates of a specific location.\n\nUsing Tuples:\n1. Accessing Items: Just like lists, you can access items in a tuple using their index:\n\n#your code goes here\n\n\n#your code goes here\n\n2. Benefits of Immutability: Since tuples cannot be changed, they are useful for storing fixed data that should not be altered. This can help prevent accidental changes to important values.\nIn oceanography, you might want to store the coordinates of a specific research station. Since these coordinates are fixed and won’t change, a tuple is the ideal choice. If you need to reference these coordinates later in your code, you can do so confidently, knowing they will not change.\n\n\n\nDictionaries\nA dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs, similar to how a real dictionary has words (keys) and their meanings (values). Each key in a dictionary must be unique, and you can use it to access its corresponding value. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {}.\n\n#your code goes here\n\nIn this example, we have a dictionary called student_data that stores various pieces of information about a student’s academic details.\n\nUsing Dictionaries:\n1. Accessing Values: You can retrieve a value using its corresponding key.\n\n#your code goes here \n\n2. Adding or Modifying Values: You can easily add new key-value pairs or modify existing ones:\n\n#Modify Existing one\n#your code goes here \n\n\n#Adding new key-value pair\n#your code goes here \n\n3. Removing Key-Value Pairs: You can remove a key-value pair using the del statement:\n\n#your code goes here\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\nCreate a dictionary named countries with these key-value pairs:\n\n\n“United States” : “English”\n“Mexico” : “Spanish”\n“France” : “French”\n“Canada” : “English and French”\n\n\nAdd a new entry to the dictionary: “Brazil” : “Portuguese”\nRemove the key “France” and its value using the del statement.\nPrint the updated dictionary every time.\n\n\n#your code goes here\n\n\nChoosing the Right Data Structure\nSelecting the appropriate data structure is crucial. Here’s a quick guide:\n\nUse Lists when you need to store a collection of items that you might want to change or add to, like student grades over multiple subjects or assignments.\nUse Tuples for fixed data points that won’t change, such as geographic coordinates of research locations.\nUse Dictionaries when you need to associate related information together, such as all academic details for a specific student.\n\nChoosing the right data structure will make your data management more efficient and your code easier to understand."

    "section": "Control Structures",
    "text": "Control Structures\nControl structures are essential programming constructs that allow us to dictate the flow of our program. In Python, the most commonly used control structures include loops (for and while) and conditionals (if and else). These structures enable us to repeat actions, make decisions based on conditions, and manage how we process data.\n\nConditionals\nConditionals allow us to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. This means that our program can make decisions and act differently depending on the situation. The most common conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else.\n\nBasic Structure of Conditionals:\nHere’s a simple structure for using conditionals:\nif condition: # Code to execute if the condition is true elif another_condition: # Code to execute if the first condition is false and this one is true else: # Code to execute if both conditions are false\n\n\nComparison Operators\nComparison operators allow us to compare two values. Here are the most commonly used comparison operators in Python:\n==: Equal to (checks if two values are the same) !=: Not equal to (checks if two values are different) &gt;: Greater than (checks if the left value is larger than the right) &lt;: Less than (checks if the left value is smaller than the right) &gt;=: Greater than or equal to (checks if the left value is larger than or equal to the right) &lt;=: Less than or equal to (checks if the left value is smaller than or equal to the right)\nLet’s say we want to categorize towns based on their population size:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nIn this example:\n\nIf the population is less than 5,000, it prints “Small town.”\nIf the population is between 5,000 and 20,000 (inclusive), it prints “Medium-sized town.”\nIf the population is over 20,000, it prints “Large town.”\n\n\n\nLogical Operators\nLogical operators allow us to combine multiple conditions. The most commonly used logical operators are:\n\nand: Returns True if both conditions are true.\nor: Returns True if at least one condition is true.\nnot: Reverses the truth value (makes True become False and vice versa).\n\nLet’s say we want to check if someone’s annual income falls within the middle-income bracket:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nIn this example:\n\nThe condition annual_income &gt;= 30000 and annual_income &lt;= 70000 checks if the income is between 30,000 and 70,000 inclusive.\nIf both are true, it prints “Middle-income bracket.”\n\n\n\n\nLoops\nLoops allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times. This is especially useful when we have to process a collection of items, like a list of temperature readings or salinity measurements. The two primary types of loops in Python are for loops and while loops.\n\nFor Loops:\nA for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or a tuple). Here’s the basic structure:\nfor item in sequence: # Code to execute for each item\nLet’s say we want to print out each survey response score from a list:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nIn this example, the loop goes through each item in the survey_scores list and prints it.\nFor loops are useful for analyzing data, such as calculating the average monthly income from several months:\n\nmonthly_incomes = [3000, 3200, 3100, 2900, 4000, 3500, 2500, 2900, 3050, 3200, 3500, 2950]\n#your code goes here\n\nIn this case, the loop adds up all the monthly incomes and then finds the average by dividing by the number of months.\n\n\n\nExercise 4\n\nYou are given a list named populations that contains population numbers (in thousands).\nUse a for loop to add all the population numbers together and store the total in a variable called total_population.\nCalculate the average population by dividing the total population.\nPrint the average population rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\n\npopulations = [2731, 631, 1135, 934, 1705]\n\n#your code goes here\n\n\nWhile Loops\nA while loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true. The basic structure looks like this:\nwhile condition: # Code to execute while the condition is true\nLet’s say we want to keep recording monthly expenses until we have data for five months:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nIn this example, the loop keeps asking for monthly expenses until it has collected five amounts.\nWhile loops are useful for continuous data collection, like tracking monthly donations until reaching a target amount:\n\n#your code goes here\n\n\n\n\nCombining Loops and Conditionals\nOften, we will need to use both loops and conditionals together to process data effectively. For example, you might want to analyze temperature readings and categorize them within a loop.\nLet’s categorize a list of temperature readings as “Cold,” “Warm,” or “Hot”:\n\n#your code goes here\n\nIn this example, the loop goes through each temperature reading, and the conditional statements categorize each temperature accordingly.\nNow, let’s say we want to use a loop to analyze data stored in a dictionary. We have a dictionary of historical events and the years they happened. Using a for loop, we can go through each event and year, and use a control structure like an if statement to check whether the event happened before or after 1900.\n\n#your code goes here\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nYou are given a dictionary of universities worldwide with their average graduation rates (in percentages):\nuniversities = { “Harvard University”: 98,\n\"University of Oxford\": 92,\n\n\"Stanford University\": 94,\n\n\"Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\": 92,\n\n\"University of Cambridge\": 93,\n\n\"University of Tokyo\": 70,\n\n\"University of Melbourne\": 79,\n\n\"University of Cape Town\": 68,\n\n\"University of São Paulo\": 65,\n\n\"National University of Singapore\": 80\n}\nTask:\n\nLoop through each university and its graduation rate.\nPrint the university name and its graduation rate.\nUse conditional statements to classify the graduation rate:\n\n90% or above: print “Excellent graduation rate”.\nBetween 75% and 89% (inclusive): print “Good graduation rate”.\nBelow 75%: print “Needs improvement”.\n\n\n\n#your code goes here"

The default simply raises TypeError.\n\n        If *sort_keys* is true (default: ``False``), then the output of\n        dictionaries will be sorted by key.\n\n        To use a custom ``JSONEncoder`` subclass (e.g. one that overrides the\n        ``.default()`` method to serialize additional types), specify it with\n        the ``cls`` kwarg; otherwise ``JSONEncoder`` is used.\n\n    dumps(\n        obj,\n        *,\n        skipkeys=False,\n        ensure_ascii=True,\n        check_circular=True,\n        allow_nan=True,\n        cls=None,\n        indent=None,\n        separators=None,\n        default=None,\n        sort_keys=False,\n        **kw\n    )\n        Serialize ``obj`` to a JSON formatted ``str``.\n\n        If ``skipkeys`` is true then ``dict`` keys that are not basic types\n        (``str``, ``int``, ``float``, ``bool``, ``None``) will be skipped\n        instead of raising a ``TypeError``.\n\n        If ``ensure_ascii`` is false, then the return value can contain non-ASCII\n        characters if they appear in strings contained in ``obj``. Otherwise, all\n        such characters are escaped in JSON strings.\n\n        If ``check_circular`` is false, then the circular reference check\n        for container types will be skipped and a circular reference will\n        result in an ``RecursionError`` (or worse).\n\n        If ``allow_nan`` is false, then it will be a ``ValueError`` to\n        serialize out of range ``float`` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) in\n        strict compliance of the JSON specification, instead of using the\n        JavaScript equivalents (``NaN``, ``Infinity``, ``-Infinity``).\n\n        If ``indent`` is a non-negative integer, then JSON array elements and\n        object members will be pretty-printed with that indent level. An indent\n        level of 0 will only insert newlines. ``None`` is the most compact\n        representation.\n\n        If specified, ``separators`` should be an ``(item_separator, key_separator)``\n        tuple.

This feature\n        can be used to implement custom decoders (e.g. JSON-RPC class hinting).\n\n        ``object_pairs_hook`` is an optional function that will be called with the\n        result of any object literal decoded with an ordered list of pairs.

By default this is equivalent to\n        float(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser\n        for JSON floats (e.g. decimal.Decimal).\n\n        ``parse_int``, if specified, will be called with the string\n        of every JSON int to be decoded. By default this is equivalent to\n        int(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser\n        for JSON integers (e.g. float).\n\n        ``parse_constant``, if specified, will be called with one of the\n        following strings: -Infinity, Infinity, NaN.\n        This can be used to raise an exception if invalid JSON numbers\n        are encountered.\n\n        To use a custom ``JSONDecoder`` subclass, specify it with the ``cls``\n        kwarg; otherwise ``JSONDecoder`` is used.\n\nDATA\n    __all__ = ['dump', 'dumps', 'load', 'loads', 'JSONDecoder', 'JSONDecod...\n\nVERSION\n    2.0.9\n\nAUTHOR\n    Bob Ippolito &lt;bob@redivi.com&gt;\n\nFILE\n    /usr/lib/python3.13/json/__init__.py\nLet’s get started with some hands-on API querying!\nFor our first example, we’ll use an easy-to-understand API from catfact.ninja, a site that serves up random cat facts, perfect for learning the basics in a fun way.\n1.

For example, there’s a “birth_year” key whose value is “19BBY” as well as an “eye_color” key whose value is “blue.”\nWe can refer to the JSON data by its key:\n\nhair = first_person_info[\"hair_color\"]\nname = first_person_info[\"name\"]\n\nprint(f\"{name} \\'s hair is: {hair}\")\n\nLuke Skywalker 's hair is: blond\n\n\nIn the statement above, we are setting a new variable called hair. The variable is composed of the value of the hair_color key, as specified in the data you see in the previous cell.\nWe also set a variable called name, which is composed of the value of the name key. Then we tell the program to print those values"
